BuildingPlanner
---------------

Ever want to plan your building or structure before actually gathering the materials for it? BuildingPlanner lets you designate a planning zone where you have infinite resources while inside that zone, then you can commit the plan, add the materials to the supply chest and watch your plan take shape.

Not only does it let you place infinite blocks, but when you make mistakes, a single punch will clear a block instantly inside the planning zone.
