description: "Building planner lets you mark out a zone for planning structures. When\
  \ you enter that zone, you will enter a special 'mode' where you'll have access\
  \ to every placeable block and you'll be able to instantly delete blocks.\r\n\r\n\
  Once your planning is complete, the building will disappear and then you fill a\
  \ special chest with the required building materials, as you fill it, the building\
  \ will build itself!"
